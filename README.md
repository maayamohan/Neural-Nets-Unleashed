I was first introduced to Neural Networks through a PESU I/O course called Neural Nets Unleashed. Some of the files in this directory are created my the SMEs that conducted the course.
- CNNs.ipynb
- Modelling_in_PyTorch.ipynb
- Neural Networks Fashion MNIST.ipynb
- NeuralNetworksFromScratchwithRegularization.ipynb
- PyTorch_Tensors.ipynb
- RNN_LSTM_NeuralNetsUnleashed.ipynb
- Tensorboard.ipynb
- TikToken.ipynb
- Visualizing Probabilities.ipynb

The remaining notebooks have been created by me for course assignments or personal projects.
